# bingimagescraper
A Selenium web scraper script which retrieves photos from Bing's image search

Based on three criteria inputted by the user, the program will create a directory, retrieve 140 .jpg images from Bing's image search and place them in the newly created directory.
The program will ask for the "search name", file format (jpg or gif), and whether the user would like safesearch enabled.

1.) Run the program: bingimagescraper.py

2.) Enter search name, file format, and safesearch preference

3.) Wait for program to finish, this is signaled by a "Done!" print

4.) Navigate to the current directory and open the new two-lettered directory

5.) Enjoy 140 images of your search from Bing!
